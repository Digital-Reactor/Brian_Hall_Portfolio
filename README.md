### Advanced Illness Management Product Development
Developed Advanced Illness Management product for value-based providers that addressed a $104M per year gap in care by utilizing a machine learning algorithm that allowed for early identification of patients. Developed analytics and process for targeting markets, services and teams required to serve needs.

Analysis required a difficult merging of market, physician, patient, care teams, hospice & claims datasets.  


These visualizations showing recommended service areas were produced in Tableau Desktop.  Product & Provider names have been redacted.
